I am Kasper Ã˜sterbye, a lecturer at a Danish undergraduate school, who teach computer science up to Bachelor level. Previously I have had a more than 25 year university career, research, projects, teaching at all levels up to and including PhD. For seven years I was head of studies at the IT University of Copenhagen. I joined Copenhagen Business Academy in 2015.

In the spring of 2018 it became clear to me that it was more than 10 years ago since I last spend some time working abroad. I have done that a few times earlier in my career, both longer stays (California and Norway for a few years), and shorter stays (New Zealand and Washington state for several months), and really enjoyed working in a completely different environment, but also placing myself in really nice surroundings as I like nature.

I was able to agree with my wife that I could leave for some months in the winter. 

I mentioned to my boss that I was interested in doing a longer stay abroad, and we agreed that two months sounded plausible. The financing is roughly 50/50 in that the school gave me one month for the project, and I have worked overtime for the first two months placing all my teaching obligations in the first two months (it has been busy), and some other obligations I have to keep up  from the Azores. Travel, housing and living costs are on my own.

I looked if I could visit a place in Europe wich would be good for hiking in winter, had a university were I would get colleagues to talk to, students to take at least partial responsibility for, and a subject I wanted to teach. 

Exactly why I at some point put my eyes on the university of the Azores is a bit unclear - Malta, Sardina, and a bunch of other places might have been just as plausible to contact. 

I surfed the pages of the university of Azores using automatic translation from Portuguese to English to get a feel for what their computer science program was about, and who might be the contact person (program responsible we call it at cphbusiness.)

Long story short, I got a positive response from the Matthias Funk that I should be welcome, and if I could teach blender and python (3D graphics). I said I had not done so before, but that it was on the list of things I wanted to learn anyways.

And then it was mostly a set of practicalities to be sorted out...
