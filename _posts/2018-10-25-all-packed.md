I am **so ready** to leave now. I used most of the fall break to refresh and catch up on blender. I know it will still be a struggle to keep my pace with the students and the course, but I also have a full week down there before I take over. I am sure it will be amazing.

I have gotten myself a small appartment near the university, but actually it does not really matter as the city is not so big.

### Where are these Azores
Well, the Azores is nine Portuguese islands in the Atlantic sea. This picture might give you an idea:

The islands are somewhat spread out, more than 100 km from the main island of São Miguel to the others further west.

On the map you might be able to see the city named Ponta Delgada. That is where I will be staying. 

There are around 250.000 people living on the islands. About half of them lives on São Miguel, and about half of those live in Ponta Delgada. That makes it comparable to Esbjerg, or about half the size of Aalborg.

The climate seems to be wet, and I expect rain about half the days I am there. Temperatures seems to be between 10 and 20, with little difference beween night and day.
