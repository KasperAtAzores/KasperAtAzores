The main part of the class, and where the students learn to apply their skills, is through project work. The students work in groups of 2-3, and work on many different animation and game projects. I am not sure I remember them all, but there are at least the following:

* An animated dance battle between two robots - rendered in a kind of film-noir style.
* A Mars rover that can pick up a stone using some grabbing mechanism
* A forklift that can pick up a container. This group 3D prints the model as well for making the forklift using ardoino as well
* A platform game where an a green android robot has to collect points, and fly using a jet-pack
* A submarine game where you have to control the submarine to pick up some barrels with atomic waste and move them to a safe place. The water around is filled with mines.

I am sure I have forgotten some - sorry about that.

I have had several talks with my host about what seems like a discrepancy between what the students do in their project, and what is taught in at the more theoretical level. It is a bit unclear what is the solution, if the students see it as a problem, and if the projects should be more theoretical or the lectures more practice oriented.
